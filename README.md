WARNING! This project is the result of me tinkering with JMemorize2 by https://github.com/riadd.
This poject can be found here: https://github.com/riadd/jMemorize.

That particular project is probably more stable then my version, in particular I don't know if jml is still as stable
as it was (raise an issue if it is not).

I did the following:
- split the code into a model, swing and I/O modules
- added a lot of unit tests (not enough, yet)

I have more plans than time:
- I'd like to introduce tags instead of lessons
- I'd like a cassandra module to store cards and tags
- I'd like a JavaFX use interface
- I'd like to try out Vaadin as a user interface
- I'd like a conversion to epub format
- I'd like to improve working with media, in particular pictures
- I'd like to use asciidoc as a means of writing q&a's, but als other formats
